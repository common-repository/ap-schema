Creates review boxes which also displays star ratings in the search results.

== Description ==

AP Schema provides an easy way to create a review summary box in your posts and pages which are loaded with Rich Snippets or Schema. This information is combined with your google plus account in order to show your rating as stars in the search results.

A Google plus account is required if you want the stars in the search results, but not required for the plugin to create a review box on your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do  I really need a Google plus account? =

You do not need a Google plus account to use the plugin, but in order to get the full benefit from the plugin and see the stars rating in Google search results, you **do** need an account.

= I have a Google plus account but the stars aren't working! =

Did you link your website to your Google plus account? If not you need to. See here for instructions [Google plus help](http://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=98085&topic=1257354&ctx=topic/ "Google Plus help").

Also it is IMPORTANT to note that it is up to Google whether the stars show for your listing or not.
